# Factorial-Calculator-n
This program calculates the factorial of the number that the user wants. A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by each number below it. For example 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. The function is used, among other things, to find the number of ways in which “n” objects can be arranged.
